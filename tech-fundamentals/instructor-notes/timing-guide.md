# Tech Fundamentals Timing Guide (2 Hours)

Audience: 12–14 year-olds, beginners. **Goal**: build confidence with computers,
files, and the terminal. Keep energy light and celebrate curiosity.

## 0:00–0:10 - Welcome & Comfort Icebreaker

- **Objective**: lower anxiety, learn names.
- **Prompt**: "What's one thing you used a computer for this week?"
- **Reminders**: no wrong answers; curiosity beats correctness.
- **Materials**: slide or whiteboard to capture a few examples.

## 0:10–0:30 - What Is a Computer?

- **Objective**: hardware vs software mental model.
- **Demo**: show a device, point to keyboard/screen; name CPU, memory, storage.
- **Activity**: paper sort-circle which are hardware vs software.
- **Watch for**: students mixing "cloud" with "storage"; keep it simple.

## 0:30–0:50 - Files, Folders, Extensions

- **Objective**: how computers organize stuff.
- **Activity**: create `Tech-Workshop-1/` with `notes.txt` and `about-me.txt`.
- **Demo**: rename a file; show what happens when removing an extension.
- **Tip**: repeat "Files don't do anything until a program reads them."

## 0:50–1:10 - Text Editors vs Word Processors

- **Objective**: plain text vs rich text.
- **Demo**: open same file in Word (or Docs) and a plain text editor; show hidden
  formatting using `od -c` if time.
- **Discussion**: why code breaks in Word; why editors matter.

## 1:10–1:20 - Break

- **Optional**: post a quick puzzle; encourage movement.

## 1:20–1:40 - What Is Code?

- **Objective**: computers are literal; code is precise instructions.
- **Activity**: "human computer" **game**: follow vague student instructions exactly;
  debrief on missed steps.
- **Reinforce**: errors are normal; specificity is kindness to computers.

## 1:40–1:55 - First Terminal Experience

- **Objective**: demystify the terminal.
- **Commands**: `pwd`, `ls`, `echo "Hello, computer!"`.
- **Flow**: model once, then let students run and share output.
- **Safety**: remind them terminals are powerful; today is read-only and printing.

## 1:55–2:00 - Wrap-Up & Teaser

- **Objective**: reflect and connect to next workshop.
- **Prompts**: "One thing I learned…", "One thing I'm curious about…".
- **Teaser**: "Next time you'll tell the computer what to do with JavaScript."
