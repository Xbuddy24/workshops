# Next Steps After Tech Fundamentals

Keep the momentum going with a few quick wins. Pick one or two to do this week.

## Practice at Home or School

- Rebuild today's folder tree (`Tech-Workshop-1/`) and add a new file for
  something you like (music, sports, art).
- Run the three commands again: `pwd`, `ls`, `echo "Hello, computer!"`. Say out
  loud what each one does.
- Teach a friend or family member the difference between hardware and software.

## Get Ready for JavaScript Basics (Next Workshop)

- Install or open a text editor you enjoy (Notepad, VS Code, or a browser-based
  editor).
- Find one website you like and guess what files it might have (`index.html`,
  images, scripts).
- Optional: make a free GitHub account if you don't have one yet.

## Explore More (If Curious)

- Try the terminal "human computer" game at home: have someone give you precise
  instructions to move around a room; notice when the steps are vague.
- Change a file extension on a copy of a file and see what happens when you try
  to open it.
- Look up one new command (`cat` or `clear`) and write down what it does.
- Learn more Bash commands by using <https://trybash.github.io/game/> or <https://cmdchallenge.com/>.

## Keep It Safe and Fun

- Ask an adult before installing new software on a shared computer.
- Use plain text editors for practice; avoid saving code in Word or Docs.
- Celebrate small wins; every command you try is progress.
