# Text Adventure Builder
# Mission: Create an interactive story where the player makes choices!

# Step 1: Story Variables
# Create variables for your story elements
# Hint: Use descriptive names with snake_case

# TODO: Add your variables here
# Example: story_title = "The Enchanted Forest"


# Step 2: Ask the Player's Name
# Use input() to get the player's character name

# TODO: Ask for the player's name here


# Step 3: Story Opening
# Use print() and f-strings to display your story's beginning

# TODO: Display your story opening here


# Step 4: First Choice
# Use input() to ask the player to make a choice
# Use if/else to create different paths

# TODO: Ask the player a question and respond based on their answer
# Example:
# choice = input("Do you go left or right? ")
# if choice == "left":
#     print("You found a treasure chest!")
# else:
#     print("You found a friendly dragon!")


# Step 5: Story Ending
# Use your variables and the player's choices to create a personalized ending

# TODO: Create your ending here


# Extension Challenges:
# - Add more choices with elif
# - Track a score that changes based on choices
# - Ask for more user inputs throughout the story
# - Create multiple endings based on different choices
# - Use .lower() on input to handle capitalization
