# Python Coding Introduction - Starter Code

Welcome to your first Python programming mission!

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository on GitHub
2. Clone to your computer
3. Open in VS Code
4. Open the integrated terminal (View → Terminal or Ctrl+`)

## Files in This Project

- `hello.py` - Your first Python file (already complete)

```

You should see a message! This means Python is working.

**Note:** On some systems, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`.

Run your adventure anytime with:

```bash
python adventure.py
```
