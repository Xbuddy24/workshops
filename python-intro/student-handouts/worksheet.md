# Python Coding Introduction Mission Worksheet

Use this sheet to capture notes and keep track of what you learned today.

## 1) Warm-Up Check-In

- One thing I know about programming: <span class="blank-line"></span>
- One thing I want to create today: <span class="blank-line"></span>

## 2) Python Basics

Fill in the blanks.

- Python is a programming language that: <span class="blank-line-long"></span>
- Variables in Python are created by: <span class="blank-line-long"></span>
- Python uses snake_case, which looks like: <span class="blank-line"></span>
- The difference between `=` and `==`: <span class="blank-line"></span>

## 3) Variable Lab

Create three variables about yourself (write the code):

```python
# Write your code here:



```

## 4) Data Types Detective

For each value, write if it's a string, integer, float, or boolean:

| --- | --- |
| `"Learning to code"` <span class="blank-line-short"></span> | `42` <span class="blank-line-short"></span> |
| `True` <span class="blank-line-short"></span> | `"100"` <span class="blank-line-short"></span> |
| `3.14` <span class="blank-line-short"></span> | `False` <span class="blank-line-short"></span> |

## 5) print() and input() Practice

What will this code display and do when you run it?

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
color = input("Favorite color? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}! You like {color}!")
```

What happens first: <span class="blank-line-long"></span>

What happens next: <span class="blank-line-long"></span>

Final output (if you type "Alex" and "blue"): <span class="blank-line-long"></span>

## 6) Reflection

- Coolest thing I learned today: <span class="blank-line-long"></span>
- Something I want to practice more: <span class="blank-line-long"></span>
- My next coding goal: <span class="blank-line-long"></span>
