2) A <span class="blank-line-short"></span> is like a labeled box where you store information. \

10) <span class="blank-line-short"></span> runs code only when a <span class="blank-line-short"></span> is true; <span class="blank-line-short"></span> runs code when it's false.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Quick Checks

- Circle the valid variable names: `player_name` / `player-name` / `player name` / `playerName`
- Draw a line matching data types to examples:
  - String &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `42`
  - Integer &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `"Hello"`
  - Float &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `True`
  - Boolean &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `3.14`

## Stretch: Code Detective

Find and circle the mistakes in this code:

```python
player name = "Sam"
age = input("How old are you? )
if age = 13
    print(f"You are {age} years old!")
```

Hint: Look for spaces in names, missing quotes, the wrong equals sign, and a missing colon!
