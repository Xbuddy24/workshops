**Python:** A popular programming language known for being easy to read and used in web development, science, AI, and more.

**variable:** A named container that stores a value; like a labeled box for information.

**string:** Text data wrapped in quotes, like `"Hello"` or `'World'`.

**integer:** A whole number without a decimal point, like `42` or `-5`. Also called `int`.
